# Investment Replica
Group project on MATLAB for the Fintech course of Politecnico di Milano. Developed in collaboration with Giorgia Nicoletti, Filippo Puricelli, Fabrizio Raeli and Fiamma Ruscito.

### Description
We developed an algorithmic model for index replication, to copy strategies used by hedge funds or high-frequency trading companies. 

Using time series data of common Futures and indexes on global stocks, we first performed some data cleaning and visualization. Then, we developed the replica using Lasso Regression with rebalancement and trading costs optimization. We also developed a Kalman Filter model. 

Finally, metrics were used to evaluate error, volatility, and net gain of the replica.
